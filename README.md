# drc_wrapper
## lab-specific functionality for the drc package
## wrapper function for drc with summary data files as input.  
 
 
### Input args:  

1. **`summaryFile_root_dir`**: root dir with files (character).   
2. **`doseFun`**: LL.4 for 4-parameter log logistic or W1.4/ W2.4 for 4 par Weibull (character).  
3.  **`featureName`**: Measure of interest (character).   
4. **`EDs`**: Dose response derived measures vector of numerics.    
5.  **`controlTreat`**: (character) If provided, will divide by this value on plate to plate and cell line basis.  
6.  **`minmaxNorm`**: (boolean) If TRUE, will perform minmax normalization on plate to plate and cell line basis.  
7.  **`zeroDoseTreatment`** (character) If any, what treatment should be plate-cell_line specific zero concentration?  
8.  **`nConc`**: Number of concentrations in your dose responses, dose-response curves with less than `nConc` are removed.  
9. **`minRespL`**: Minimum absoluut response level defined as max-min for the dose response curve. Note if `minmaxNorm = TRUE` or
10.  **`controLTreat`**: If defined, the scale of your input values will change accordingly.  
11.  **`startpars`**: List containing 4 parameters start values in a vector per slot; index of the slot should correspond to curve. Slots can be NULL  *DEBUG*: only for debugging script, leave as FALSE. The order is b c d e with b = slope, c = min, d = max, e = inflection point  
12. **`calibrated`**: Setting to FALSE is usefull to find parameter solutions one by one and adjust start-values. No dose response estimates are calculated unless set to TRUE (logical)  
13.  **`plotProcData`**: Sript is slower, set to FALSE only after modifying filter or normalization steps. plot normalized non fitted data, handy for checking normalization/ data and estimate starting pars (logical) 
14.  **`lowerl`**: Lower bounds for parameters, passed on to ED function, see drc::ED for details 
15.  **`Upperl`**: High bounds for parameters, passed on to ED function, see drc::ED for details 
16. **`rmData`**: data.frame with identical headers and entries to remove. Possible headers are 'cell_line', 'treatment', 'dose_uM', 'plateID', 'replID', 'plateWellID', 'variable' Use to remove e.g. treatmant-dose combinations where GFP response declines due to cell death  
17.   **`test1`**: (integer or NULL) Usefull to start testing on a single curve  
18.   **`maxOfTime`**: (logical). In case you have time course data you can choose to select the max value from each individual time curve.  
19.   **`finalAnalysis`**: Attempts drm function with identical c & d parameters and `separate = TRUE`, performs mixed linear modeling with interaction terms. Will likely only work with very high quality data or low amount of curves. See drm manual for details.    

### Default args:  
```R

summaryFile_root_dir = ".", 
                        doseFun = "LL.4", 
                        featureName = NULL,  
                        EDs = c(10, 25, 50, 80),  
                        controlTreat = NULL, # to divide by  
                        minmaxNorm = FALSE,   
                        zeroDoseTreatment = NULL, # to define for each treatment a zero concentration using this control-treatment  
                        nConc = NULL,  
                        minRespL = NULL,  
                        startpars = NULL,  
                        DEBUG = FALSE,  
                        calibrated = FALSE,  
                        plotProcData = TRUE,  
                        lowerl = NULL, upperl = NULL,  
                        rmData = NULL,  
                        test1 = NULL, 
                        maxOfTime = NULL,
                        finalAnalysis = FALSE, ...)  

```     

### Possible workflow:                         

use b c d e parameters for the 4-parameter log logistic functions as described below.  
keep calibrated set to FALSE untill the fits are converging.  

$$ f(x) = c + \frac{d-c}{1+\exp(b(\log(x)-\log(e)))} $$

with b: Hill's slope of the curve (i.e. this is related to the steepness of the curve at point c).   
with c: min value  
with d: max value  
with e: the point of inflection (i.e. the point on the S shaped curve )  


Weibull W1.4:  

$$ f(x)=c+(d−c)exp(−exp(b(log(x)−log(e)))). $$

with b: Hill's slope of the curve (i.e. this is related to the steepness of the curve at point c).  
with c: min value  
with d: max value  
with e: the point of inflection (i.e. the point on the S shaped curve )  
 
startpars in order b c d e   
 
#### step 1: setting drc_wrapper arguments 

* set root dir of summary data files  
* set feature name of interest.  
* set `controlTreat` if you require fold change with respect to defined `controlTreat`  
* set `minmaxNorm` if you require minmax normalization  
* set `zeroDoseTreatment` so all curves have a zero concentration  
* set `nConc` to number of concentrations in your dose response curves   
* set `minRespL` to minimum response level (recommended as will remove non responsive curves)  
  
test with `test1 = 1` (or other curve number) and plot fit for manual inspection  
  
#### step 2: calibration  

define 1 set of start parameters eg: `startpars[[1]] <- c(1,1,1,2)`
run with `calibrated = FALSE` and `plotProcData = TRUE`  
adjust `minRespL` startpars or remove data with `rmData` if numerical optimizations are not converging  
You might want to remove dropping stress response signals at higher concentrations if you know cells are dying.   
check your plot in /output (`plotProcData = TRUE` creates figure of your data) if you change `rmData`, `minRespL` or `nConc`.  

#### step 3: perform ED estimations   

run with `calibrated = TRUE`  
  
#### step 4: manual inspection  

repeatedly run the lines with `i= 0: ` 
```R

i=i+1  
plot(data_result$model.out[[i]],  main = data_result$CurveName[[i]], type = "all")  
log(data_result$ED_est[[i]], base=10)  
```
#### step 5: re-iterate based on results.

*optional:*   
sometimes it is possible to find a full numerical optimization solution for the set of dose-responses (identical min and max ll4 parameters).  
run with `finalAnalysis = TRUE ` 
with `plot(data_result$model.out)` and `summary(data_result$model.out)` you can check the results.
